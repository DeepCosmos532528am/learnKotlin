}/*In Kotlin, <T> in a generic function means you're writing a function that works with any type, and T acts as a placeholder for that type.
<T> before the function name means "this function is generic with type T".
T is not a fixed type like Int, String, etc. â€” it becomes whatever type is passed when calling the function.*/
